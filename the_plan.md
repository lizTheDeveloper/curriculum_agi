The Layers:

1. The Inference Layer - the LLMs that produce the output, and a method to get to them

2. The Agentic Framework - the classes that connect prompts and tools to LLM input and output

3. The Prompt Layer - The actual prompts that we use to get stuff to happen

4. Agent Environment - Behavior Loop - How does the agent behave over time, and how is that measured and surfaced to the agent so that it understands the results of it's actions
